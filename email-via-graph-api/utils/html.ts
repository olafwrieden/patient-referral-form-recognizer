  Please note the fax gateway received a document which we don't think is a

  <li>
    If this is a referral:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Please download the PDF, then process it manually, transcribing if
        necessary; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Please also forward to to example@example.com so we can make some
        adjustments to the solution to stop these coming through on email.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If it is not a referral, please print off and process as you normally would
    from a fax machine.
